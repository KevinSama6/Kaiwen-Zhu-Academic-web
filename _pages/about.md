üíª I‚Äôm a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto.

üß† My research interests are in software automation, machine learning, and data-driven intelligence.


Selected Experience
======
üß© Software Development


At Tesla, I designed and deployed the Power Automate Workflow System (Project 2070) ‚Äî a fully automated Power Platform solution integrating triggers across Power Apps, Power BI, and SharePoint. The system streamlined feedback and reporting workflows for all sales training programs in China. I also developed reusable Python APIs to standardize and visualize high-dimensional datasets, enabling rapid uploads to SharePoint and SQL with minimal manual intervention.

üí° Recent Research Projects
======
Recently, I‚Äôve led and contributed to several advanced machine learning projects, including:

integrating ResNet50 encoders and attention decoders for automatic [visual-to-text generation]({{'/files/Transformer based Optimized Image Capt.pdf' | relative_url}}).

[GAN-based Contrast-Enhanced MRI Synthesis Framework]({{'/files/GAN based Contrast-Enhanced MRI Synthesis Framewor.pdf' | relative_url}}), developing dual-discriminator GAN architectures to generate diagnostic-quality MRI images.

[Movie Review Analysis]({{'/files/ML Movie Review Analysis.pdf' | relative_url}}), a multi-task learning pipeline for sentiment classification, score regression, and critic prediction using BERT embeddings and XGBoost models.

üìä Data Analytics:
======

Proficient in data-driven performance analysis, capable of conducting deep-dive investigations into operational, training, and engagement datasets to uncover efficiency gaps and improvement opportunities.

Skilled in applying statistical analysis and predictive modeling (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Python, Excel) to extract actionable insights from complex, multi-source data.

üìä Reporting & Visualization
======
Experienced in building interactive dashboards and automated reporting systems using Power BI and Python, enabling real-time tracking and reducing manual reporting time.

Strong ability to translate quantitative insights into clear, visual summaries, supporting executive and operational decision-making.

Adept at communicating analytical findings through data storytelling, presentations, and reports tailored to both technical and non-technical audiences.

ü§ù Stakeholder Communication
======

Demonstrated success in collaborating with cross-functional teams (business, engineering, and training units) to align metrics and KPIs with organizational goals.

Skilled at converting qualitative feedback into measurable indicators, facilitating effective dialogue between technical and management teams.

‚öôÔ∏è Efficiency & Impact
======

Improved reporting efficiency by up to 40% through workflow automation and streamlined data pipelines.

Enhanced decision-making speed by 30% with optimized dashboards and faster access to performance metrics.

Proven ability to operationalize data insights into concrete actions that drive measurable business impact.
