💻 I’m a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto.

🧠 My research interests are in software automation, machine learning, and data-driven intelligence.

⚙️ I’ve designed Tesla’s Power Automate Workflow System (Project 2070) to streamline global operations and built reusable Python APIs for visualizing and standardizing large-scale datasets.

📊 I’m passionate about bridging technology and data — transforming complex information into actionable insights through intelligent automation.



Selected Experience
======
🧩 Software Development:
At Tesla, I designed and deployed the Power Automate Workflow System (Project 2070) — a fully automated Power Platform solution integrating triggers across Power Apps, Power BI, and SharePoint. The system streamlined feedback and reporting workflows for all sales training programs in China. I also developed reusable Python APIs to standardize and visualize high-dimensional datasets, enabling rapid uploads to SharePoint and SQL with minimal manual intervention.

🤖 Machine Learning:
My current research and projects explore how AI models can bridge visual and language modalities. From building a Transformer-based image captioning model using ResNet and attention decoders to developing a GAN framework for MRI synthesis, I aim to design interpretable, reliable, and high-impact ML systems.

📊 Data Analytics:
I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights. In both Tesla and Alcle Environmental Solutions, I leveraged Power BI and Python to visualize performance trends, standardize reporting pipelines, and design predictive models for engagement and content performance — helping teams make faster, data-driven decisions.

🌱 I’m passionate about building intelligent, scalable systems and assisting others on their journey in software engineering, data science, and academia.
